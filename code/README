The approach described in the paper are built on top of the following methods and software:

Interactive Adaptation of Real-Time Object Detectors(http://raptor.berkeleyvision.org/)
Whitened HOG approach of Bharath Hariharan(http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bharath2/)
Fast DPM/HOG detection with FFT by Francois Fleuret and Charles Dubout(http://www.idiap.ch/scientific-research/resources/exact-acceleration-of-linear-object-detectors)

render.ms: MAXScript used to render virtual and virtual_gray used in the BMVC paper
computerBB.m and computerBB_all.m: Matlab scripts used to compute bbox for virtual and virtual_gray used in the BMVC paper
reformatxml_virtual.sh and xmldeletefirstline_virtual.sh: shell scripts used to format the annotations generated by computerBB.m(this was due to the fact that the xml parser provided by VOCdevkit can not parse the xml files correctly).
