The render.ms is the file for the rendering part. All the rendered images (with annotation) are in these two folders: 'virtual' and 'virtual_gray'. The 3D models is in the '3d_models' folder. Basically, here are the brief steps:\r\n\r\n1. Download the 3D models\r\n\r\n2. Run render.ms in 3ds Max (the software we used to generate the dataset)\r\n\r\nThe are also limited comments in render.ms which might help you understand the code.\r\n\r\nTo generate more realistic images (as in the 'What Do Deep CNNs Learn About Object' paper), you may need to specify different background and texture for different category/3d model. Then you need to change the 'images_bg' and 'images_texture' in the render.ms file to point to different background and textures for different category/3d model.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
